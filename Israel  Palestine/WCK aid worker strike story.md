- Army sources: the killings were NOT due to lack of coordination between army and aid orgs, but to poor discipline among field commanders 
- Claim that officers and soldiers involved had violated IDF regulations and orders 
	- Source in the intelligence branch: The IDF Southern Command "<span style="color:#ffc000">knows exactly what the cause of the attack was - in Gaza, everyone does as he pleases</span>"
- Army regulations say action against sensitive targets must be approved by senior officers (division commander, head of the command or chief of staff)

	- Investigated by Joint Chiefs of Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism (FFAM), led by MG Yoav Har-Even 
	- Misidentification of two gunmen on the aid vehicles (vehicles not identified as WCK)
	- Strike described as a "<span style="color:#ffc000">grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the Standard Operating Procedures</span>"
	- Two people dismissed: Brigade fire support commander and brigade chief of staff 
	- Three people reprimanded, including commander of the Southern Command "<span style="color:#ffc000">for his overall responsibility for the incident</span>"

	- Ashdod, 25 miles north of Gaza 
	- Erez crossing, north Gaza (15 min drive from Gaza City) 
		- CLAIM by Israel that Erez was not usable because of Oct 7th damage
		- COUNTER that ad hoc crossing points were already being used for military traffic (why couldn't there have been one for aid) 
			- Maybe ad hoc crossings are reliable for Israeli military vehicles but not for trucks requiring inspection? 
			- Maybe, but isn't it convenient that they only did this shortly after taking a huge international blow with the WCK killings? 
	- US warning that its support now depends on immediate steps being taken to assist Gazan civilians 
		- Israeli cabinet influenced by foreign ministry officials claiming: 
			- Israel risks international sanctions and possibly an arms embargo if aid were not to increase
		- White House summary: Biden "<span style="color:#ffc000">made it clear that the US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps.</span>"

	- "<span style="color:#ffc000">WCK coordinated everything correctly with the IDF in advance</span>"
	- "<span style="color:#ffc000">A number of armed gunmen boarded and left some of the vehicles that were identified during the course of the event... after some of the vehicles split from the others, the forces that were tracking the vehicles that went south did so thinking that these were Hamas vehicles that Hamas gunmen had entered.</span>"
	- Misidentification was the result of internal failures - critical information did not go properly down the chain of command
	- Strike conducted with no awareness that these were WCK vehicles 
	- Logos not visible at night 
	- "<span style="color:#ffc000">Serious operational failures</span>", "<span style="color:#ffc000">errors in decision making</span>", "<span style="color:#ffc000">strikes conducted in violation with standard operating procedures</span>"
