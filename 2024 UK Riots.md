###### Grooming Gangs 
- [Home Office recommendations](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fd87e348fa8f54d5733f532/Group-based_CSE_Paper.pdf) for Group CSE
	- Improve communication between police and local organisations 
	- 134: Funding of local prevention officers and supporting local partners; coordinating local prevention activity across agencies and organisations 
	- 135: "We will continue working with policing and industry partners to <span style="color:#ffc000">ensure that staff working across a range of high risk-settings, including hotels, bars and shopping centres, are better placed to identify indicative signs that a child might be at risk of CSE</span> and report it to the relevant authorities. And we will support local agencies to undertake focused engagement with communities to deter potential offenders and encourage bystanders to spot and report exploitation" 
- Jay Report recommendations (2014) 
	- Risk assessment: "up-to-date risk assessments on all children affected by CSE"
	- Improve reach-out services for victims 
	- Ensure long-term support for children who had otherwise been having cases closed prematurely 
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">More direct and frequent engagement</span> between the Safeguarding Board, the Council and men and women from minority communities 
- Question: Political correctness was identified as a contributing factor by the Jay report - can people who cite this name any other factors? 
	- Victim blaming: UK police used to [routinely dismiss](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306396819895727#bibr119-0306396819895727) victims as "streetwise" and "consenting child prostitutes" 
	- Under-resourcing (working class communities)
	- [Drew Review of South Yorkshire](http://www.drewreview.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SYP030-Final-report.pdf) police identified the force using "too narrow a working definition" of CSE
		- "A related difficulty arises if a police force has too narrow a working definition of child sexual exploitation. I believe some officers certainly had this. For example, <span style="color:#ffc000">the view that child sexual exploitation was about red light areas, and was about gangs of men principally of Pakistani heritage, led not only the force but also probably the whole partnership to look for signs of exploitation in the wrong places.</span> One superintendent, describing the exploitation challenge today in his area, characterised the local problem of revolving around ‘white European males, in their mid 40s, making extensive use of the internet for initial grooming, often of boys, and not operating as gangs at all.’ This is a very different profile."

	- [Home Office](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/944206/Group-based_CSE_Paper.pdf) challenges unreliable data from the 2010s, arguing: 
		- 81. "While some of the research set out above suggests that there are high numbers of offenders of Asian or Black ethnicities committing group-based CSE offences, it is not possible to say whether these groups are over-represented in this type of offending. As set out in paragraph 75, research to date has relied on poor-quality data with a number of weaknesses. It remains difficult to compare the make-up of the offender population with the local demography of certain areas, in order to make fully informed assessments of whether some groups are over-represented. <span style="color:#ffc000">Based on the existing evidence, and our understanding of the flaws in the existing data, it seems most likely that the ethnicity of group-based CSE offenders is in line with CSA more generally and with the general population, with the majority of offenders being White.</span>"
