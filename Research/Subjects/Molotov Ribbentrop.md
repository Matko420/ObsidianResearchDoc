##### Operation Barbarossa 
- Hitler emboldened by the fall of France and the seemingly impending collapse of Britain
	- Red army decimated by Stalin's purges and proven to be incompetent in the war with Finland 
	- "Racial inferiority" of Slavs and weakness of Bolshevism boosted German confidence 
- Nazi motives for invading

	- Dependency on supplies from Eastern Europe 
		- Nov 1940: Molotov discussed future co-operation in Berlin
		- Jan 1941: Soviets sign a new trade agreement, doubling grain exports from Ukraine to the Third Reich (Hitler convinced that the Soviet Union had an almost unlimited supply of foodstuffs that would be essential to Germany's future)
- Timeline
	- 18 December 1940: Hitler orders the armed forces to be ready to invade the Soviet Union the following spring 
		- Motivated by fear of the USA joining the war by 1942; desire to encourage Japan by defeating their enemy to the west 
		- <span style="color:#ffc000">"if Russia is smashed, it is the end of any hopes that might move England still to hope for a change in the situation."</span> - Hitler to his generals in July 1940 
		- 200 German divisions prepared to match roughly the same number in the Red Army 
			- Soviets had more equipment but many of their machines were obsolete; new production hindered by the purges; <span style="color:#f894ff">lack of production managers, designers, military commanders and senior air force officers </span>
	- Early-mid 1941: Nazis stockpile in the border area and improve railway and communications in Poland
		- Finland mobilised to recover lost territory from the Winter War 
		- 18 divisions supplied from Romania 
		- Small number of Hungarians mobilised
		- 45,000 Spanish volunteers brought to the Leningrad front 
	- May - early June 1941: Soviets record columns of German armed forces moving towards the border
		- Stalin tries to appease the Germans by stepping up deliveries of supplies; even as Soviet agents warn that invasion is imminent, this is only seen as further evidence of economic hard-ball 
			- <span style="color:#ffc000">"As a dogmatic Marxist-Leninist, Stalin was convinced that Hitler's regime was the tool of German monopoly capitalism, so that if he made available everything German business wanted, there would be no immediate reason to invade."</span>
			- <span style="color:#ffc000">"Already under trade provisions agreed under the Nazi-Soviet pact early the previous year, the Soviet Union was supplying nearly 3/4 of Germany's requirement of phosphates, over 2/3 of its imported asbestos, only a little less of its chrome ore, over 1/2 of its manganese, over 1/3 of its imported nickel and, even more crucially, more than a third of its imported oil."</span> (Evans, p. 165)
		- Vetoes proposals to disrupt the German military build-up by attacking across the demarcation line in Poland
	- 5 May 1941: Stalin admits "War with Germany is inevitable" but seems to believe the Red Army wouldn't be prepared until 1942 or 1943 
		- The General Staff had no plans for attack or for defence 
	- 15 May 1941: Early Soviet Intelligence predictions of an invasion on May 15th (though accurate at the time) turn out to be wrong
		- Barbarossa delayed in order to invade Greece and Yugoslavia (weather conditions too poor in the East)
		- Newer predictions of a German invasion on 22 May become discredited
	- 21 June 1941: Ex-Communist soldier deserts the German forces, swims across a river to tell the Soviets that he had been given orders to invade the following morning; Stalin has him shot for spreading 'disinformation'
	- 22 June 1941: Germany invades the Soviet Union 
##### Stalin's position
- Weakened military due to years of purging his top generals, munitions factory managers and senior army officers. <span style="color:#ffc000">"There were few left in the higher echelons of the regime with any direct experience of warfare. Competent technical experts had been arrested and killed in their thousands. Soviet military preparedness was lamentable."</span> (Evans, p. 692)
- Enticing prospect of watching Europe's capitalist powers fight a war of mutual destruction
##### Hitler's position
- Soviet assistance was necessary for the invasion of Poland, otherwise a war on two fronts would be highly possible 
##### Consequences 
- Neither side believed the pact would last 10 years  
- Baltic states remained occupied until the 1990s 
- European Communist parties struggle to sell the pact
	- Many antifascists become disillusioned, though most are held in line by party discipline 
	- War between capitalist powers ultimately seen as none of their business 
	- Stalin viewed as a great thinker and master of political strategy 
- Some Nazis felt betrayed
	- Front garden of the Brown House (Nazi HQ in Munich) filled with party badges of disgruntled members 
	- Majority ultimately trusted Hitler's judgement 
	- Goebbels: <span style="color:#ffc000">"The Leader has made a brilliant move"</span> 
##### Misc
- <span style="color:#ffc000">"As many as one in three of the Polish citizens deported to Siberia and other remote areas of the Soviet Union was Jewish; 100,000 are estimated to have died in the process."</span>
